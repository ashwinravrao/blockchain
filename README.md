# Blockchain App (CSC 435 Final Project)

Multi-threaded command line blockchain application, where each thread competes to solve a work puzzle and receive priority access to the blockchain to insert its records. Work in this application is simulated for brevity. In a real implementation of blockchain, work would most likely be some complex mathematical puzzle. Built as the final project for my graduate course on distributed systems (CSC 435 Distributed Systems I) at DePaul.
